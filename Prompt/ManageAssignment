Help me optimize this react component. I am using jupyterlab extension template to create this react component.
This is the structure of this React Component:

-Component ManageAssignmentPage
    - Component 'LeftNavBar'

    - Component 'Assignment Overview'
        - Component 'Notebooks'
            - Component 'Convert to nbgrader Assignment Button'
            - Component 'Notebook Item'

    - Component 'Submissions'
        - Component 'submission table'

    - Component 'Back to Home Button'

The description for each Component:

Component ManageAssignmentPage (props: assignmentname, app:juypterfrontend):
    i. it contains Three Subcomponent: 'LeftNavBar', 'Assignment Overview' and 'Submissions'

Component 'LeftNavBar'
    i. It is a left side bar on the left side of the page.
    ii. It contains two options on the left sidebar: 'Overview' and 'Submissions'
        a. When user click on 'Overview', it will change the main area to Component 'Assignment Overview'
        b. When user click on 'Submissions', it will change the main area to Component 'Submissions'
    iii. 'Overview' is the default Component to show in the main area

Component 'Assignment Overview' (props: assignmentname)
    i. then show Title: 'Assignment: [assignmentname]'.
    ii. It contains Component Notebooks

Component 'Notebooks' (props: assignmentname)
    i. it should fetch the information of the notebooks by request to ManageAssignmentHandler. (contain assignmentname in the request)
    ii. For each Notebook, show a Component 'Notebook Item' its link (where users can click on it and open the notebook)
    iii. For each Component 'Notebook Item' show a Component 'Convert to nbgrader Assignment Button' on his right side

    ii. Create a row for each submission (each item in dictionary)
    iii. Create a column 'Student', it shows the name of students, who submited the Notebook
    iv. Create a column 'Notebook', it is the name of the submited Notebook by particular student.
    v. make each value of Notebook column a link (where users can click on it and open the notebook)

Component 'Back to Home Button'

Firstly, understand the structure of the Components. Then undertand describtion and details of each component. Finally integrate these components into the structure, and generate the code.

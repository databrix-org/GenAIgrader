Help me optimize following react components. This is the Structure of the components i want to optimize:

- Component 'Assignment Overview'
    - Component 'Notebooks'
        - Component 'Convert to nbgrader Assignment Button'
        - Component 'Notebook Item'


This is the description of each component:

Component 'Assignment Overview' (props: assignmentname, assignmentdirectory)
    i. Show Title/Header in the middle of the main area: 'Assignment: [assignmentname]'
    ii Show words 'open in filebrowser'. This is a like to open the assignment directory in jupyterlab filebrowser.
    iii. show a Notebook container, show 'Jupyter Notebooks' on the top of container
    iv. Notebook Container contains Component 'Notebooks'.

Component 'Notebooks' (props: assignmentname)
    i. it should fetch the information of the notebooks by request to ManageAssignmentHandler. (contain assignmentname in the request)
    ii. the response contains Notebook names and coursedirectory path. let assignmentfilepath of each notebook = coursedirectory path / source / Notebook name
    iii. For each Notebook, show a Component 'Notebook Item' in a row. Pass assignmentfilepath to it.
    iv. Set pad between each row
    v. For each Component 'Notebook Item' show a Component 'Convert to nbgrader Assignment Button' on his right side. set a pad between thems

Component 'Notebook Item' (props: assignmentfilepath)
    i. it is link (where users can click on it and open the notebook)
    ii. make this link blue, and the cursor will be a pointer if it is above the link.
    iii. show a Jupyterlab Icon 'Notebook' on the left side of the Notebook Item.

Component 'Convert to nbgrader Assignment Button'
    i. it is a button for user to click on
    ii. The button shows words 'generate Assignment'

Firstly, understand the structure of the Components. Then undertand describtion and details of each component. Finally integrate these components into the structure, and generate the code.
